<h1>Alexander McMaster</h1>
<p>I am a writer and ecologist working creatively with the seas. A regular contributor to The Irish Times, I have also published investigative work on fishing conflicts, pollution and piracy.</p>

<p>My work engages coastal communities with the sea through ecology and the arts. I work around the island of Ireland and co-direct an environmental NGO in the Ionian Sea. A professional diving instructor, underwater photographer and seafarer, I am also part of Northern Irish charity Refugee Rescue, operating in the Central Mediterranean.</p>
    
<p>My roots are on the Atlantic coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>MA Ecology, Culture and Society, Goldsmiths University of London.<br />
    BSc Biology and Geography, University of St Andrews.
